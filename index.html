<h1>ROMEO AND JULIET</h1>
<p>ACT I</p>

<strong>PROLOGUE</strong> <br>
<br>
<em style="color:rgb(102, 5, 39);">>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</em> 
<br>
<br>
<strong>SCENE I.</strong> <em>Verona. A public place.</em>  <br>

<p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>

<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
No, for then we should be colliers.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
I strike quickly, being moved.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:<br>
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will<br>
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes<br>
to the wall.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,<br>
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push<br>
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids<br>
to the wall.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I<br>
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the<br>
maids, and cut off their heads.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
The heads of the maids?<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;<br>
take it in what sense thou wilt.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
They must take it in sense that feel it.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and<br>
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou<br>
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes<br>
two of the house of the Montagues.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
How! turn thy back and run?<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
Fear me not.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
No, marry; I fear thee!<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as<br>
they list.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;<br>
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.<br>
<br>
Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR<br>
<strong>ABRAHAM:</strong> 
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
I do bite my thumb, sir.<br>
<strong>ABRAHAM:</strong> 
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say<br>
ay?<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
No.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I<br>
bite my thumb, sir.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
Do you quarrel, sir?<br>
<strong>ABRAHAM:</strong> 
Quarrel sir! no, sir.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.<br>
<strong>ABRAHAM:</strong> 
No better.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
Well, sir.<br>
<strong>GREGORY:</strong> 
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong>  
Yes, better, sir.<br>
<strong>ABRAHAM:</strong> 
You lie.<br>
<strong>SAMPSON:</strong> 
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.<br>

<p>They fight <br>
Enter BENVOLIO <br>
</p>
<strong>BENVOLIO:</strong> 
Part, fools! <br>
Put up your swords; you know not what you do. <br>
Beats down their swords <br>

<p></p>Enter TYBALT</p> <br>
<strong>TYBALT:</strong> 
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<br>
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.<br>
<strong>BENVOLIO:</strong> 
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,<br>
Or manage it to part these men with me.<br>
<strong>TYBALT:</strong> 
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,<br>
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:<br>
Have at thee, coward!<br>
<p>They fight <br> </p>
  
<p>Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs<br>
First Citizen<br>
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!<br>
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!<br>
Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET</p><br>
<strong>CAPULET:</strong> 
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!<br>

  <strong>LADY CAPULET:</strong> 
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?<br>
<strong>CAPULET:</strong> 
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,<br>
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.<br>
  
<p>Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE<br> </p>
<strong>MONTAGUE:</strong> 
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.<br>
<strong>LADY MONTAGUE:</strong> 
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.<br>
<p>Enter PRINCE, with Attendants</p><br>
<strong>PRINCE:</strong> 
<p>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,<br>
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<br>
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<br>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,<br>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,<br>
And made Verona's ancient citizens<br>
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br>
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br>
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:<br>
If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>
For this time, all the rest depart away:<br>
You Capulet; shall go along with me:<br>
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,<br>
To know our further pleasure in this case,<br>
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<br>
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.<br>
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO<br></p>
  
<strong>MONTAGUE:</strong> 
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<br>
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?<br>
  <strong>BENVOLIO:</strong> 

<p>Here were the servants of your adversary,<br>
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:<br>
I drew to part them: in the instant came<br>
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,<br>
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,<br>
He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br>
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:<br>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<br>
Came more and more and fought on part and part,<br>
Till the prince came, who parted either part.<br></p>
  <strong>LADY MONTAGUE:</strong> 
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?<br>
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.<br>
